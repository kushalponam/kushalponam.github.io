  <p> I am Kushal, a passionate video game developer currently pursuing Masters in Entertainment Arts and Engineering at University of Utah. 
      I have been professionally developing games from past 5 years and have developed 17 games so far in team size of 4-5. Some of the games I would like to highlight are: 
			1.) VoltCity: Educational game acquired by the Casa da Luz,Electricity Museum in Portugal.
			2.) RehabCity: Serious game that aims at Rehabilitating patients recovering from strokes. This game is currently in use at a hospital in Portugal.
		Over these last few years, I have also developed a keen interest in the design aspect of games and see myself contributing to it as well if required. 
		Having worked in diverse teams, I believe I am a good team player. Needless to say, I am also a big time gamer, 
		some of my favorites being Super Mario bros, Zelda , Dark Souls, League of Legends, StarCraft.</p>
