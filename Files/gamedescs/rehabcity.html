	<h1>RehabCity</h1>
    
	<p>RehabCity is a rehabilitation game focused at cognitive training for patients recovering from brain strokes. In the game,player has to complete objectives that 
	   are based on activities of daily living. These objectives are given to train particular abilities of the player such as Memory, Attention, Sense of Orientation etc..
	</p>
	<p>This project was funded by NueroRehabLab at Madeira Interactive Technologies Institute. RehabCity is installed at the hospital at Madeira and is being used by the patients.</p>
	<p>I worked on this and built the game from scratch. More datails on the project <a href="https://neurorehabilitation.m-iti.org/tools/RehaCity">website </p>
