	<p>WAYLA was developed as a capstone project while I was pursuing my Master's at Carnegie Mellon University. Our goal was to find if Gaze based interaction works as input for games.
	   We built several prototypes to test different interactions. Based on the results from our research, we decided to go with rapid eye movements and peripheral vision as an input for the game,using Tobii Pro Tx300 Eyetracker.

	<p>
		The game takes places inside a computer, where couples are working together to send packets of data. An Evil monster is jealous of seeing couples happy together and installs bad thoughts into
		their heads, as a result they fight and packets drop. Player plays as an angel, getting couples back together. So, player has to look at the couples who are mad with eachother. As the game progresses, 
		player has to use his/her peripheral vision to locate next target.
